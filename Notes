# Interview Questions for Front-End Developers

This repository contains interview questions for front-end developers that can be used to filter potential candidates. We do not recommend using every question for every candidate (it would take hours). Selecting a few questions from the list could help assess the skills you're looking for in candidates.

The article "Baseline For Front-End Developers" by Rebecca Murphey is also a great resource to read before conducting an interview.

*Note:* Many of these questions may lead to interesting discussions and can help you better evaluate the candidate's knowledge and thinking process, rather than just receiving direct answers.
